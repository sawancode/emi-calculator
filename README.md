## Usage

### Loan Calculation

The app uses the following formula to calculate EMI:

\[
EMI = \frac{P \times R \times (1 + R)^N}{(1 + R)^N - 1}
\]

Where:
- \( P \): Loan principal amount
- \( R \): Monthly interest rate (\( \text{Annual Rate} / 12 / 100 \))
- \( N \): Loan tenure in months

### Function Breakdown

**Parameters**:

- `annualRate`: Annual interest rate in percentage (e.g., 8.5 for 8.5%).
- `tenureYears`: Loan tenure in years (e.g., 20 for 20 years).

**Returns**:
